ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a quadrotor dynamic model&rsquo;s energy efficiency was investigated. A method for the design of the dynamic model which assures energy consumption estimation was presented. This model was developed to analyze the energy efficiency of the quadrotor during each maneuver. A medium-class quadrotor (4.689 kg) was used as a test platform. Thrust force correction factors obtained with FLIGHTLAB software were used to predict object behavior in forward flight. Model validation and long-duration flight tests in outdoor windy conditions are also presented. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to study the influence of uncertainties in model parameters on the simulation reliability. The developed model might be used for practical purposes (for example, energy-efficient coverage path planning).},

 abstract={This paper presents the design methodology of a small guided bomb for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This kind of next-generation munition has recently gained a lot of attention in the military market. The bomb is planned to be equipped with inertial measurement unit and infrared seeker.The nose shape and ﬁn optimization procedure was described shortly. Aerodynamic characteristics were calculated by means of theoretical and engineering-level methods. The ﬂight dynamics model of the bomb was obtained and implemented in Simulink software. The numerical simulations of uncontrolled and controlled trajectories were compared. The results indicate that the usage of such a guided small munition, like the designed bomb, might improve signiﬁcantly the oﬀensive capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.},
