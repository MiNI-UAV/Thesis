ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a quadrotor dynamic model&rsquo;s energy efficiency was investigated. A method for the design of the dynamic model which assures energy consumption estimation was presented. This model was developed to analyze the energy efficiency of the quadrotor during each maneuver. A medium-class quadrotor (4.689 kg) was used as a test platform. Thrust force correction factors obtained with FLIGHTLAB software were used to predict object behavior in forward flight. Model validation and long-duration flight tests in outdoor windy conditions are also presented. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to study the influence of uncertainties in model parameters on the simulation reliability. The developed model might be used for practical purposes (for example, energy-efficient coverage path planning).},

 abstract={This paper presents the design methodology of a small guided bomb for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This kind of next-generation munition has recently gained a lot of attention in the military market. The bomb is planned to be equipped with inertial measurement unit and infrared seeker.The nose shape and ﬁn optimization procedure was described shortly. Aerodynamic characteristics were calculated by means of theoretical and engineering-level methods. The ﬂight dynamics model of the bomb was obtained and implemented in Simulink software. The numerical simulations of uncontrolled and controlled trajectories were compared. The results indicate that the usage of such a guided small munition, like the designed bomb, might improve signiﬁcantly the oﬀensive capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.},

Their relationship to more familiar concepts, including those of perfectly diffuse and specular reflectance, is given, and they are applied to illustrative examples. It is shown that, when the usual reciprocity relationship holds, the reflectance for a ray incident on an opaque surface element is related by Kirchhoff's law to the emissivity of that element for a ray emitted along the same line in the opposite sense.},

ABSTRACT = {Attitude estimation is the process of computing the orientation angles of an object with respect to a fixed frame of reference. Gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer are some of the fundamental sensors used in attitude estimation. The orientation angles computed from these sensors are combined using the sensor fusion methodologies to obtain accurate estimates. The complementary filter is one of the widely adopted techniques whose performance is highly dependent on the appropriate selection of its gain parameters. This paper presents a novel cascaded architecture of the complementary filter that employs a nonlinear and linear version of the complementary filter within one framework. The nonlinear version is used to correct the gyroscope bias, while the linear version estimates the attitude angle. The significant advantage of the proposed architecture is its independence of the filter parameters, thereby avoiding tuning the filter&rsquo;s gain parameters. The proposed architecture does not require any mathematical modeling of the system and is computationally inexpensive. The proposed methodology is applied to the real-world datasets, and the estimation results were found to be promising compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},
