ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a quadrotor dynamic model&rsquo;s energy efficiency was investigated. A method for the design of the dynamic model which assures energy consumption estimation was presented. This model was developed to analyze the energy efficiency of the quadrotor during each maneuver. A medium-class quadrotor (4.689 kg) was used as a test platform. Thrust force correction factors obtained with FLIGHTLAB software were used to predict object behavior in forward flight. Model validation and long-duration flight tests in outdoor windy conditions are also presented. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to study the influence of uncertainties in model parameters on the simulation reliability. The developed model might be used for practical purposes (for example, energy-efficient coverage path planning).},
